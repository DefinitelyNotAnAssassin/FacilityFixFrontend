## üß™ Testing Plan

### Test 1: Basic Auto-Assignment
**Goal**: Verify auto-assign works

```
Steps:
1. Create 3 staff in Electrical department
2. Create 1 task in Electrical category
3. Open task ‚Üí Click "Assign Staff"
4. Click "Auto-Assign" button

Expected:
‚úì Task assigned to first available staff
‚úì Success message shows staff name
‚úì Pointer incremented to 1
```

### Test 2: Round-Robin Rotation
**Goal**: Verify fair distribution

```
Steps:
1. Use 3 staff from Test 1
2. Create 6 tasks in Electrical
3. Auto-assign all 6 tasks

Expected:
‚úì Staff 1: 2 tasks
‚úì Staff 2: 2 tasks  
‚úì Staff 3: 2 tasks
‚úì Perfect distribution
```

### Test 3: Persistence
**Goal**: Verify state survives restart

```
Steps:
1. Complete Test 2 (pointer at position 0)
2. Refresh browser / restart app
3. Create new Electrical task
4. Auto-assign

Expected:
‚úì Assigns to Staff 1 (continues rotation)
‚úì Does not restart from beginning
```

### Test 4: Department Isolation
**Goal**: Verify departments independent

```
Steps:
1. Create 2 staff in Plumbing
2. Create 2 staff in Electrical
3. Auto-assign Plumbing task (goes to Plumbing Staff 1)
4. Auto-assign Electrical task (goes to Electrical Staff 1)
5. Auto-assign Plumbing task (goes to Plumbing Staff 2)

Expected:
‚úì Each department maintains own rotation
‚úì No cross-department interference
```

### Test 5: No Available Staff
**Goal**: Verify error handling

```
Steps:
1. Create department with no staff
2. Create task in that department  
3. Click "Auto-Assign"

Expected:
‚úì Shows error: "No available staff found"
‚úì Does not crash
‚úì Can still manually assign
```

### Test 6: API Failure
**Goal**: Verify graceful failure

```
Steps:
1. Disconnect from internet
2. Try to auto-assign

Expected:
‚úì Shows error message
‚úì Pointer not incremented
‚úì App does not crash
```

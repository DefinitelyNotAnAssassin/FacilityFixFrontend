# Quick Start: Round-Robin Task Assignment

## 🚀 Implementation Complete!

The round-robin assignment system has been successfully implemented. Here's what was added:

## 📁 New Files Created

### 1. Core Service
**`lib/adminweb/services/round_robin_assignment_service.dart`**
- Main service handling round-robin logic
- Maintains department-specific assignment pointers
- Integrates with existing API services

### 2. Documentation
**`lib/adminweb/ROUND_ROBIN_ASSIGNMENT.md`**
- Complete documentation
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide

### 3. Examples
**`lib/adminweb/services/round_robin_examples.dart`**
- Code examples for developers
- Demo widget for testing

## 🔧 Modified Files

### 1. API Service Enhancement
**`lib/adminweb/services/api_service.dart`**
- Added `assignStaffToWorkOrder()` method for work order/maintenance assignments

### 2. Assignment Popup
**`lib/adminweb/popupwidgets/assignstaff_popup.dart`**
- Added "Auto-Assign" button (orange button with refresh icon)
- Integrated round-robin service
- Automatic task type and department detection

## ✨ How to Use

### For Admins (UI)

1. **Open any task** (Concern Slip, Job Service, Work Order, or Maintenance)
2. **Click "Assign Staff"** button
3. **Choose one:**
   - **Auto-Assign** (orange button) - Let the system assign fairly
   - **Manual Assign** (green button) - Select specific staff member

### For Developers (Code)

```dart
import 'package:facilityfix/adminweb/services/round_robin_assignment_service.dart';

// Create service instance
final rrService = RoundRobinAssignmentService();

// Auto-assign a task
final assignedStaff = await rrService.autoAssignTask(
  taskId: 'CS-2025-00123',
  taskType: 'concern_slip',
  department: 'electrical',
);

if (assignedStaff != null) {
  print('Assigned to: ${assignedStaff['first_name']}');
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **Fair Distribution** - Automatically rotates through all available staff  
✅ **Department Isolated** - Each department has its own rotation  
✅ **Persistent State** - Remembers position after app restart  
✅ **Manual Override** - Admins can still manually assign when needed  
✅ **No Backend Changes** - Works with existing API endpoints  

## 📊 Assignment Flow

```
Task Created → Auto-Assign Clicked → System:
  1. Identifies department (from task category)
  2. Fetches available staff in that department
  3. Gets current pointer for department
  4. Assigns to staff at pointer position
  5. Increments pointer for next time
  6. Saves pointer to storage
```

## 🔄 Pointer Management

Each department maintains an independent counter:

```
Electrical: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0 (wraps around)
Plumbing:   0 → 1 → 2 → 0 (wraps around)
Maintenance: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 0 (wraps around)
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Supported Task Types
- `concern_slip` - Tenant repair requests
- `job_service` - Scheduled service tasks  
- `work_order` - Work permit requests
- `maintenance` - Preventive maintenance

### Supported Departments
- `electrical`
- `plumbing`
- `hvac`
- `carpentry`
- `maintenance`
- `security`
- `fire_safety`

### Add New Departments

Edit `assignstaff_popup.dart` → `_handleAutoAssign()`:

```dart
case 'your_new_category':
  department = 'your_new_department';
  break;
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Auto-Assign Feature

1. **Create Test Staff**
   - Go to User Management
   - Create 3-4 staff members in same department
   - Mark them as "Available"

2. **Create Test Tasks**
   - Create several tasks in that department
   - Click "Assign Staff" on first task
   - Click "Auto-Assign"
   - Verify assignment

3. **Verify Rotation**
   - Repeat for next task
   - Should assign to different staff member
   - Continue until all staff have been assigned once

4. **Check Persistence**
   - Close and reopen app
   - Create another task
   - Auto-assign should continue from where it left off

## 📱 UI Location

The Auto-Assign button appears in:
- **Concern Slip assignment dialog**
- **Job Service assignment dialog**
- **Work Order assignment dialog**
- **Maintenance task assignment dialog**

Look for: **Orange button with refresh icon** labeled "Auto-Assign"

## 🔐 Permissions

No special permissions needed. Uses existing:
- `SharedPreferences` for local storage
- Existing API authentication
- Current staff permissions system

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No available staff found"
**Solution:** 
- Add staff members to the department
- Ensure staff are marked as available
- Check department mapping is correct

### "Auto-Assign button not visible"
**Solution:**
- Rebuild the app: `flutter clean && flutter run`
- Check you're on the admin web interface
- Verify you have admin permissions

### "Assignment failed"
**Solution:**
- Check backend API is running
- Verify task has valid category/department
- Check browser console for error details
